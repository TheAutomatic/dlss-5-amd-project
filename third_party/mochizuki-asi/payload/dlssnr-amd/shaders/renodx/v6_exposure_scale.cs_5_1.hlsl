// Feed v2 (NRFeedMode): the NR input scale from the game's own exposure
// instead of from frame content.
//
// The DLSS contract (Programming Guide 3.9 / 3.9.2): the 1x1
// ExposureTexture's first channel is the value "which when multiplied to
// the input color values brings middle gray to an expected level ...
// typically the same value provided to the renderer's tonemapper", with
// DLSS.Exposure.Scale as its correction factor; DLSS.Pre.Exposure is a
// factor the engine pre-multiplied and "later removed (divided out) during
// tonemapping".  The tonemapper's input is therefore
//   color * Exposure * ExposureScale / PreExposure
// (ExposureValue = 0.18 / (AverageLuma * 0.82): mid-grey lands near 0.2).
// Feeding NR that domain puts the game's mid-grey where the game's own
// tonemapper puts it, and it holds still while the game's eye adaptation
// swings: the proxy moves only when the displayed image does.  The divisor
// the encode applies (proxy = color / divisor) is therefore
//   texture present:  divisor = PreExposure / (Exposure * ExposureScale)
//   pre-exposed only: divisor = 1 - the buffer IS the tonemapper input
//                     already; dividing by PreExposure would undo the
//                     game's adaptation (REVIEW_SH2_FLICKER_V630 section 1)
// v1 (v6_autoscale) derives the divisor from a 64x36 content histogram
// under its own attack/release clock; that second clock, racing the game's
// adaptation, is the slow pulsing v2 exists to remove.  There is no
// estimator and no rate limit here: the game's exposure is the signal.
// The read is legal because 3.4 puts every DLSS input, the exposure texture
// included, in NON_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE for the evaluate, and this dispatch
// is recorded inside that window on the same list.
//
// Source (CPU-chosen, see FrameFeed; the FeedSource values): 1 = read the
// exposure texel at t0, 2 = fixed divisor 1, 3 = hold (the exposure view
// ring is full this frame).  A texel that is non-finite or outside
// 2^-24..2^24 - an unwritten texture, a zero, a garbage convention - holds
// the previous committed divisor, or 1 when there is none (SnapNow, or an
// uninitialized texel).
// The cross-frame state lives in Commit (u1), the 1x1 UAV the v1 governor
// also uses, read-then-written by one thread: .r/.g are v1's (v6_autoscale
// owns them; this shader carries them through untouched), .b the value v2
// holds through an unreadable frame, .a the range guard's last decision.
//
// Range guard (Guard != 0: NRFeedMode Auto on a texture feed, see
// PrepareFrameScale).  The divisor above is only as right as the texel's
// convention, and the guide's contract is the only evidence there is: a
// texel that is a log2 EV, a reciprocal, or a value from another pass puts
// the whole frame stops away from mid-grey, and nothing in the formula
// notices - the texel passes the 2^-24..2^24 sanity range and NR receives a
// frame that is black or clipped.  The guard measures what the reading does
// to THIS frame: the geometric-mean luminance of the same 64x36 lattice
// v6_autoscale samples (work0 at t1, valid samples only), exposed by the
// reading, must land in [0.22 * 2^-5, 0.75].  0.22 is the guide's exposed
// mid-grey (ExposureValue = 0.18 / (AverageLuma * 0.82)), five stops under
// it is a night scene the game's own exposure left dark, and 0.75 is the
// encode's shoulder: an average above it is a frame the proxy clips.  A
// reading outside the band - with 0.5 stop of hysteresis once tripped, so a
// scene at the edge does not alternate - uses v1's committed divisor, which
// v6_autoscale wrote this frame before this dispatch (the conservative
// existing feed, rate-limited by its own governor), and reports state 5.  A
// frame with too few valid samples (under 1/16 of the lattice: a loading
// screen) keeps the last decision.  Forced NRFeedMode=2 runs unguarded.
//
// Output (u0, norm_scale) .r is the divisor the encode and resolve read
// (t3 of the pass sets) and the dark gate's unit (v6_commit_exposure);
// .g the divisor this frame's reading implied (0 = none), .b the raw
// exposure texel (-1 = non-finite), .a the state for NRNormTrace: the
// Source for a fresh value (1 texture, 2 fixed), else 3 held, 4 defaulted
// to 1, 5 guarded (v1's divisor in use).
