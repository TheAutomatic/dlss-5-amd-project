// One workgroup samples a fixed 64x36 lattice from the current linear source
// and builds a log2 histogram. Black/negative/non-finite samples are ignored,
// so letterbox bars do not drag the proxy scale toward zero. The median of the
// positive scene samples is mapped to 0.30 in the model proxy. This is a
// same-command-list transform: no readback, history, warm-up, or stale scale.
//
// One-sided guardrail (v6.1.0): the scale may only ever SHRINK an over-range
// proxy, never brighten a frame just because that frame is dark - a dark
// sample and an underscaled sample are indistinguishable from one frame, so
// under-range inference is left to authoritative exposure evidence. Engage
// only when over-range is PROVEN: at least ~3% of valid lattice samples sit
// above the encode shoulder (0.75) at divisor 1, the flat-white failure class
// measured on AW2 relative-linear HDR (capture planes: p10=p50=p90=0.9995
// whenever the divisor missed). Well-placed sources (display-referred 0..1
// content) carry no shoulder mass and keep divisor 1 unchanged.
//
// Normalization governor (v6.1.2): everything above produces a CANDIDATE.
// What the codec consumes is a COMMITTED divisor that may only move
// SlewStops per frame toward it.  The split matters because the two failure
// classes this addon has shipped pull in opposite directions: v6.0's
// stateful CPU estimator could freeze on a stale garbage factor, and
// v6.1.0's stateless estimator re-derives cleanly every frame but cannot
// notice that it is oscillating.  Keeping estimation per-frame and
// stateless makes a frozen estimate unrepresentable; rate-limiting only the
// commitment makes a single-frame step unrepresentable.  A title whose own
// exposure moves the buffer statistics under us (UE5 PreExposure: the gate
// below then crosses 1/32 back and forth) is the case this exists for.
//
// The committed value lives in Commit (u1: .r committed, .g this shader's
// flags - 1 the hold bit below, 2 mode 3's pending re-prime - stored as
// their sum; .b/.a are v6_exposure_scale's and pass through, as .r/.g pass
// through it, so a guarded v2 frame keeps a pending re-prime), a 1x1 UAV that never leaves
// UNORDERED_ACCESS, is never bound as an SRV, and is read-then-written by
// exactly one thread of the single dispatched group - so the read-modify-
// write needs no barrier beyond the cross-frame UAV barrier the host
// records before this dispatch.  There is no readback and no CPU state: a
// starved fence cannot starve this the way it starved the v6.0 stats feed.
//
// Stable governor (GovernorMode 2, v6.3).  Two defects survive the v6.1.2
// slew, and both show as brightness breathing rather than stepping:
//   - the ESTIMATOR is discontinuous.  The 1/32 gate multiplies a median
//     term, so a scene whose shoulder fraction hovers at the gate (flat fog
//     under a title's own pre-exposure) flips the candidate between 1.0 and
//     median/0.30 - most of a stop - and a symmetric slew only turns each
//     flip into a ramp, i.e. sustained pumping at the slew rate.
//   - the LIMIT is per frame, so the breathing speed scales with the NR
//     frame rate (half under frame generation, double at 120 Hz).
// Mode 2 keeps the estimator stateless and per-frame but CONTINUOUS: the
// gate becomes a smoothstep weight in log2(shoulder fraction) (0 at 1/64,
// 0.5 at the v6.1 gate, 1 at 1/16) scaling the median term in stops, and
// the median is interpolated within its histogram bin.  The commitment adds
// the two properties a control loop needs to be quiet: asymmetric limits
// supplied per frame from wall-clock rates (attack = divisor rising, the
// over-range/clipping direction, fast; release = relaxing, slow), and a
// hysteresis hold - the commit moves only after the candidate has left it
// by kEngageStops and then tracks until within kSettleStops.  The hold state
// is one bit in Commit.g, so the whole loop still lives in this 1x1 UAV:
// no readback, no CPU state, nothing a starved fence can freeze.  Holding
// can leave the applied divisor up to kEngageStops from a live candidate -
// bounded, and re-evaluated from live pixels every frame, which is what
// separates it from the v6.0 lock.
//
// Cut-aware Stable (GovernorMode 3, v7.0.0-rc11, NRNormCutAware): Stable
// read a black frame as evidence.  No lattice sample above the shoulder
// gives candidate 1, so the commit released at 0.5 st/s through every
// loading screen and fade, and the scene after it came back that many stops
// under-divided: measured 4.94 st low after 10 s of black on a divisor-32
// scene, 1.2 s of over-range NR input at the 4 st/s attack.  Mode 3 holds
// the commit on a frame the meter cannot read, which is fewer than
// kReadableSamples lattice samples above the transfer's 1/1024 floor at the
// committed divisor: a frame NR itself sees as black.  A dim scene still
// reads (a night scene sits 4-7 stops under day, the floor is 8.3 under the
// committed median), so it relaxes as before and NR's night look is
// unchanged.  A snap asked for on an unreadable frame (the game's Reset on
// a cut to black, or a first frame) waits in Commit.g (flag 2) for the
// first readable one.  Modes 0-2 never take either path.
